Example of setting up a backend server using Node.js and Express.js framework. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using a terminal.

Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

csharp
Copy code
npm init -y
Install the required dependencies. In this case, we'll need Express.js and any other packages you may require for your application. Run the following command to install Express.js:
Copy code
npm install express
Create a new file called server.js in your project directory.

Open server.js in a text editor and add the following code to set up a basic Express server:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define routes and middleware here

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
Define your routes and middleware in the designated area. For example, you can create an API endpoint to handle banning requests:
javascript
Copy code
// Example ban endpoint
app.post('/api/ban', (req, res) => {
  // Handle ban request using Pangea API
  // Access request parameters using req.body
  // Implement your logic here

  // Send a response
  res.send('User banned successfully');
});
Save the changes to server.js.

Start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
node server.js
Now, your backend server is up and running on port 3000. You can define additional routes and implement the Pangea API integration logic as needed. Remember to replace the example ban logic with the actual Pangea API calls for banning users.

Please note that this is a basic setup to get you started. You may need to configure additional settings and handle other aspects of your chat app, such as database integration, authentication, and authorization.
